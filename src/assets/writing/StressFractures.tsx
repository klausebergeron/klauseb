      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As so eloquently put by
        Jaqueline C. Nanfito, humans are constantly at odds with their own
        minds; limited by the fact of solipsism we exist in a perpetual state of
        contextualizing ourselves&mdash;questioning who we are, what is right
        and wrong, and how we fit into our environment. This becomes an onerous
        ordeal for the individual bombarded by cultural contradictions. Such
        clashing results from the contact of different cultures, a frequent
        occurrence in the 18th - 19th century. During this time period, many
        European nations adopted the practice of colonizing foreign lands by
        conquering and subjugating the peoples, usually under the guise of
        &ldquo;mission civilisatrice,&rdquo; the notion that they were helping
        the barbarous natives, or the &ldquo;Other,&rdquo; by imposing a
        European version of society upon them. Colonization leads the colonized
        to undergo &ldquo;a series of traumatic cleavages&rdquo; (Nair, 130) of
        their self-identity, and the struggle between them manifests itself in a
        variety of psychological abnormalities. The characters of Tsitsi
        Dangarembga&rsquo;s{" "}
        <span style={{ fontStyle: "italic" }}>Nervous Conditions</span> and
        Elena Garro&rsquo;s{" "}
        <span style={{ fontStyle: "italic" }}>
          It&rsquo;s the Fault of The Tlaxcaltecas
        </span>
        , suffer such conditions, and are forced to navigate life trying to
        reconcile their dichotomous sense of self. Here we will examine how
        colonialism leads to the development of ontological angst, and the
        subsequent psychological struggles these characters undergo.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Europeans were driven to
        make contact and colonize Africa and the Americas by two predominant
        motives: exploiting the country&rsquo;s resources and bringing their
        religion to the natives. Throughout colonial history the means of
        achieving such goals vary from bloody invasions to simple missions, but
        in every case the chain of cause and effect disseminates the Anglican
        influence further than it may seem, or was even intended. This is how
        colonization has such profound impacts on the mental state of the
        colonized.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In{" "}
        <span style={{ fontStyle: "italic" }}>Nervous Conditions</span>, Tambu
        introduces the reader to the landscape of Rhodesia with a tone of great
        admiration. She describes the nature, the bountiful wilderness rife with
        native fruit: &ldquo;mataba and matanduru. Sweet and sour.
        Delicious&rdquo; (3). She proceeds to detail how the locals would bathe
        and do their laundry in the river and children would play on its banks.
        Then the tone shifts: &ldquo;This is how I remember it in my earliest
        memories, but it did not stay like that&rdquo; (3). Going on, she
        explains how the milieu transformed when District Council houses were
        built near the spot where people bathed. The proximity set off a chain
        reaction of displacement and eventually what was once a spot for washing
        and frivolity became a bus terminus with little tuckshops, and the
        washing is moved upstream. It isn&rsquo;t a direct attack&mdash;there is
        no means of force, and yet the development changes the lives of all
        residents in the area. This brings us to our first example of the
        process by which colonialism infiltrates the mind of the native. As
        Fanon puts it, &ldquo;cutting railroads through the bush, draining
        swamps, and ignoring the political and economic existence of the native
        population are in fact one and the same thing&rdquo; (182). There is no
        example of active resistance to the change in Tambu&rsquo;s community,
        nor voiced sentiments of desire to go back, but we can infer the
        presence of a silent longing for it by Tambu&rsquo;s actions: when she
        was &ldquo;feeling brave,&rdquo; she would return to where people used
        to bathe, shed her clothing and &ldquo;swim blissfully for as long as
        [she] dared in the old deep places&rdquo; (4). Even in this childhood
        moment, Tambu feels a desire to hold on to her roots, but knows the
        context has changed and she must now sneak and stress to do what was
        once routine, only for so for as long as she dares.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Tambu, Laura{" "}
        <span style={{ fontStyle: "italic" }}>dares</span> to seek out
        connections to her heritage. When she leaves to find her cousin/husband
        the second time, she is doing so at her own peril; in Hispanic
        communities, adulterous women are admonished and it is generally
        acceptable for the cuckolded husband to avenge the offense with
        beatings, or even uxoricide. By taking this risk, Laura is
        &ldquo;transforming herself into a protagonist, instead of a passive
        entity eager to please the conqueror, she is openly re-appropriating
        history&rsquo;s means of production&rdquo; (Montes Garc&eacute;s, 125).
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far more overt an
        influence on our characters is the exaction of the European&rsquo;s
        second goal: to spread their religion. The import of Christianity does
        not directly affect Laura, but she experiences her past life during the
        fall of Mexico City at the hand of Spanish Conquistador, Hernan
        Cort&eacute;s. We can see from Cort&eacute;s&rsquo;s correspondence with
        Charles V in 1520, although Cort&eacute;s sought to both exploit
        resources <span style={{ fontStyle: "italic" }}>and</span> introduce
        Christianity, leading up to the attack the only real conflict between
        him and Aztecs had been religious differences. Based on this, it could
        be said that Cort&eacute;s&rsquo;s religious aims instigated the bloody
        war Laura found herself a part of. The surreal
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only means by which
        any of the characters in{" "}
        <span style={{ fontStyle: "italic" }}>Nervous Conditions</span> can be
        educated is Christian schools. For Tambu, getting an education is the
        motivation for nearly every decision she makes. She works to raise money
        for her own tuition and through the conflicts at the mission she keeps
        herself composed, even insipid at times, for the sake of that aim:
        &ldquo;Coming to the mission, continuing my education, and doing well at
        it, these had been the things that mattered&rdquo; (166). Because
        educational institutions for native Rhodesians were limited as such,
        Tambu is heavily influenced by Christianity. The religion is pervasive,
        and Babamukuru, as the most educated of Tambu&rsquo;s family, adheres
        the most strictly to its ideology. Going through the English-installed
        education system places him in a category referred to by Fanon as the
        &ldquo;national bourgeoisie&rdquo; (99). These are a sort of middle-men
        between the English and the natives; they speak English but also Shona,
        are well off but not rich, are privileged but still oppressed because of
        their race. Fanon defines the imperative duty of the national
        bourgeoisie as to &ldquo;betray the vocation to which [he] is destined,
        to learn from the people, and to make available to them the intellectual
        and technical capital it has culled from its time in the colonial
        universities&rdquo; (Fanon, 99). While Babamukuru does everything in his
        power to give his children and family opportunities to be educated, he
        still &ldquo;derives his notions of good and evil from his religious
        upbringing&rdquo; (Waugh, 86) and tries to inculcate them in Tambu,
        Nyasha, and the rest.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Babamukuru&rsquo;s
        unique status as national bourgeois and family patriarch allows us to
        map the &ldquo;relationship between sanctioning of their authority and
        the ambiguous positioning of such authority in relation to the
        discourses of colonialism&rdquo; (Osei-Nyame, 58). When the family
        gathers in the kitchen of the homestead to discuss the recent
        misfortunes, it is suggested that such difficulties &ldquo;are being
        sent&rdquo; (148). Jeremiah proposes &ldquo;a good medium to do the
        ceremony properly with everything&mdash;beer, a sacrificial ox,
        everything&rdquo; to rid them of the curse. Babamukuru remonstrates this
        idea, placing the blame on the fact that his brother never officially
        married Tambu&rsquo;s mother. He demonstrates that &ldquo;submitting to
        an alien system of education also meant a transformation of traditional
        cultures and a threat to existing structures of power within the family,
        clan, and community&rdquo; (Nair, 134) when he orders Tambu&rsquo;s
        parents to go through with an official Christian wedding ceremony (149).
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consequent wedding
        is Tambu&rsquo;s breaking point, where the culmination of her cultural
        whiplash manifests itself overtly as paralysis. This is a crucial
        moment; until then Tambu had silenced any doubts about Babamukuru, or
        the way he asserted things were and should be, out of respect for the
        opportunity he had given her, and &ldquo;keeping within those boundaries
        [she] was able to avoid the mazes of self-confrontation&rdquo; (118).
        Gradually she becomes conflicted about his Christian notions of right
        and wrong, with particular regard to sin:
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <span style={{ width: "50%" }}>
          [Sin] had to be avoided because it was deadly. I could see it. It was
          definitely black, we were taught. It had well defined edges, and it
          was square rather than round so that you knew where it ended. It
          worked like a predatory vacuum, drawing the incautious into itself and
          never letting them out. And now Babamukuru was saying that this was
          where my parents were, which meant myself and my sisters too. I could
          not associate myself or mine with sin so I smothered my misgivings in
          literal interpretations of the things we were taught in Sunday School
          ... Yet Babamukuru was sure enough that my parents were sinning to
          want to provide a wedding for them ... It was a complex problem, too
          complex for me to think my way out of, so I pushed it once more to the
          back of my mind. (152-3)
        </span>
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        On the day of the wedding, these anxieties become so powerful that she
        has a visceral experience of a dual identity. Unable to move, she leaves
        her body and watches the contentious morning unfold from afar.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the moral
        ambiguity, the interplay of established Shona culture and the Christian
        education element elucidates the presence of another social binary; male
        versus female. All the ambivalence previously discussed results in two
        different breeds of quandary for males and females. Babamukuru and his
        wife, Maiguru, start at the same place&mdash;they are offered the same
        scholarships, thought to be intelligent and disciplined young people (a
        couple, no less) but &ldquo;although they are both products of the
        colonial education system...Babamukuru&rsquo;s relationship with his
        society and with colonial culture is fundamentally different from that
        of his wife&rdquo; (Osei-Nyame, 58), as he becomes the patriarch and she
        becomes the patriarch&rsquo;s wife, a position defined by the male she
        is associated with. Maiguru makes her own money but cannot use it for
        personal things because of the marriage. The only thing keeping her from
        the same position as Babamukuru is her gender, and even though it
        prevents her from doing things she wants to do, in the context of Shona
        culture being married to Babamukuru &ldquo;defined her situation as
        good&rdquo; (pp. 104). Her ontological fissure was cracked open by her
        colonial education, where the already existing anxieties were
        &ldquo;funneled through the woman&rsquo;s location within a double
        (native and colonial) patriarchal structure&rdquo; (Nair, 134). Her
        stress lies in the knowledge of two lives just out of her reach: on one
        side is the life of freedom an educated woman could live which she is
        precluded from because of her obligations to her identity as Shona. On
        the other side is the position of power, the patriarch, the godly status
        to which Babamukuru is elevated because he is educated in Shona
        society&mdash;which she is precluded from as well, because of her
        gender.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gendered oppression
        present in Shona culture and the contemporary Mexican society where
        Elena Garro&rsquo;s places Laura is as equal a contributor to the mental
        trials of the characters as the racial oppression. Maiguru and Laura
        alike are victims of their status as wife. At home, the modern Laura is
        relegated to the role of the obedient housewife, subordinate of her
        well-off husband Pablo, living a life of idleness and anticipation,
        devoid of meaning. It is only when the fantastical elements of the story
        begin and she tastes a new (yet ancient) flavor of relationship with her
        cousin-husband that she becomes &ldquo;aware that in the mestizo
        community of modern Mexico [women] have been reduced to play a
        subordinate role&rdquo; (Montes Garc&eacute;s, 129). With this
        realization, she &ldquo;gains agency by positioning herself in control
        of a discourse to reaffirm and challenge the norms that regulate her
        social and historical role as a woman in Mexican society&rdquo; (Montes
        Garc&eacute;s, 119).
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to Laura&rsquo;s
        ancestry and Nyasha&rsquo;s upbringing these women experience
        &ldquo;cultural hybridity&rdquo; (Waugh, 88). Nyasha suffers this
        condition most viscerally. While Maiguru and Tambu were allowed a
        gradual entry into westernization, Nyasha had been exposed to it as a
        child, thrust right into an alien culture and yanked back out again,
        forced to draw conclusions from inconsistencies with a still developing
        mind. She tells Tambu, &ldquo;when you&rsquo;ve seen different things
        you want to make sure you&rsquo;re adjusting to the right thing&rdquo;
        (119). The consequences derived from this persistent moral, existential
        uncertainty are most visible through Nyasha because she does not have
        the same tolerance and reserve that Tambu and Maigaru share. She speaks
        her mind&mdash;but as Babamukuru was raised Shona he expects his
        daughter to act with the same insipid composure as his wife and niece,
        so her words are constantly disregarded. With a voice that falls only on
        deaf ears, she instead uses her body to speak its rebellion. By wearing
        short dresses, smoking, and starving herself, &ldquo;her body becomes
        the battleground on which she fights traditional notions of femininity
        and the displacing effects of colonialism&rdquo; (Nfah-Abbenyi, 68).
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The binary themes these
        characters struggle to reconcile&mdash;gender, religion, race,
        morality&mdash;are all precipitated by colonialism. There is no clear
        solution for any of them. The surrealist narrative style of Elena Garro
        leaves the readers with only a vague sense of resolve when after
        &ldquo;Laura had already left forever&rdquo; and Nacha says that
        &ldquo;senora Laurita was not from this time, nor was she meant for the
        senor&rdquo; (15). The only truth we are left with is that she was a
        woman out of context and that was her bane, just as it is
        Nyasha&rsquo;s, and Tambu&rsquo;s, Maigaru&rsquo;s, Babamukuru&rsquo;s,
        and all souls that have suffered the nervous conditions of the
        colonized.
