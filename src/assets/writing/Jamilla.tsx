        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes art
        successful? The world has yet to come to a consensus on what makes a
        work of art great, be it music, dance, visual, drama, or writing. There
        is, of course, a canon of great works in all these fields. What I have
        found to be the mutual element of great artistic pieces is their ability
        to convey emotion, the universal adhesive of human experience. I have
        found one of the greatest challenges of writing a narrative to be
        capturing a true human sentiment in a form which the resonates with the
        reader. Art is most prominent when emotion is at its peak, either within
        the artist or by his/her subject. It is thus easy to see how the
        incorporation of art in a story could help to frame human feeling and
        interaction in a way that we are familiar with&mdash;physically rendered
        by an artist. The authors of{" "}

        , Chingiz Aitmatov and Luigi Pirandello (respectively) use art to serve
        this purpose&mdash;to link the humanity of the characters together in a
        way accessible to the characters themselves as well as the
        reader/audience. Aitmatov and Pirandello use four distinct forms of the
        arts to accomplish this. Aitmatov uses song to drive the emotional arc
        between characters, and visual art to frame the overall sentiment in{" "}
        <span style={{ fontStyle: "italic" }}>Jamila</span>. Pirandello, on the
        other hand, uses authorship to frame the sentiment and dramatic arts to
        drive the emotional arc in{" "}
        <span style={{ fontStyle: "italic" }}>

        .
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The French poet, Louise
        Aragon, described <span style={{ fontStyle: "italic" }}>Jamila</span> as
        'the most beautiful love story in the world" (Rothfuss, 1). Though it is
        regarded as a coming of age story by many, for our purposes we will
        consider it a romance. The story (discounting the introduction about
        Seit&rsquo;s painting) reaches its true turning point upon the first
        arrival of the arts; Daniyar&rsquo;s song. Any music up until that
        moment had been Jamila&rsquo;s light hearted tunes. She loved to sing,
        expressing her vivacity and her unwillingness to suppress herself just
        to appease the elders. Still, while she is conveying an emotion, it is
        not with the passion required to stir another&rsquo;s spirit, humming
        more often than fully singing (pg. 6). Although she sings &ldquo;with
        feeling,&rdquo; she also sings &ldquo;simply.&rdquo; Seit describes
        listening to her as &ldquo;pleasant.&rdquo; (pg. 19) This is clearly not
        the way one would describe great art, and such a thing wouldn&rsquo;t be
        worth discussing unless setting the stage for an actual great work of
        art (as it is here). Aitmatov sets her up singing in this fashion just
        before Daniyar sings to increase the severity of the shift in tenor. The
        disparity is evident in Seit&rsquo;s description of Daniyar&rsquo;s song
        as &ldquo;something that came from the soul, something capable of
        arousing the same emotion in another, capable of bringing to life one's
        innermost thoughts.&rdquo; (pg. 20) The shift highlights the strength of
        Daniyar&rsquo;s character in a way striking to both the characters and
        the reader.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aitmatov chose our path
        to understanding Daniyar to be art before all else for a reason. For
        instance, had Daniyar verbally explained his past and how it made him
        feel to Seit and/or Jamila, he would have lost the air of mystery which
        defined him. His reserve, the way he seems to hear sounds inaudible to
        others (pg. 11), the way he slept along on the riverbank (pg. 12), are
        all defining features of the man. To have him open up in a generic
        fashion would obliterate this. As the Father in{" "}
        <span style={{ fontStyle: "italic" }}>
          Six Characters in Search of an Author
        </span>{" "}
        says: &ldquo;A fact is like a sack which won&rsquo;t stand up when it is
        empty. In order that it may stand up, one has to put into it the reason
        and sentiment which have caused it to exist.&rdquo; (pg. 19) When Seit
        is ruminating on Daniyar after the song he describes him as a man in
        love with life, landing on a resolution that Daniyar is not the
        indifferent person he had thought. (pg. 20) This new opinion is
        Seit&rsquo;s &ldquo;fact sack,&rdquo; which would be nothing without the
        sentiment provided. The way we, the audience, are permitted into
        Daniyar&rsquo;s mind through sentiment is far more visceral by being
        more direct. He skips the step of sending his feelings through his brain
        and articulating them before he speaks, opting rather to let them pour
        directly from his heart. Neither Seit, Jamila, nor the reader could have
        understood Daniyar&rsquo;s character to that extent if he had not sung.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But why is
        Daniyar&rsquo;s song so much more effective than Jamila&rsquo;s if they
        both have good singing voices? To answer that question let us turn to
        Pirandello. Instead of music, Pirandello uses theatrical drama to
        demonstrate the humanity of his characters, both to their fellow
        characters (mainly the Manager and Actors), and us, the audience (or
        reader). While a play can be either a comedy or a drama, they both
        contain a fair amount of theatrics&mdash;the adjective form of theatre
        itself, and a synonym for dramatic, the adjective for of drama. Collins
        dictionary defines Drama as &ldquo;a literary composition that tells a
        story, usually of human conflict, by means of dialogue and
        action,&rdquo; or &ldquo;a real situation which is exciting or
        distressing.&rdquo; Dramatic is defined to be &ldquo;filled with
        emotion, or exciting qualities; vivid, striking.&rdquo; Again, we see
        the importance of the emotional aspect and its corresponding method of
        expression. However, unlike Daniyar, the characters of{" "}
        <span style={{ fontStyle: "italic" }}>
          Six Characters in Search of an Author
        </span>{" "}
        do not sing. They accomplish the same feat of emotional expression
        verbally, through dialogue; the straightforward way that would have
        ruined Daniyar&rsquo;s characterization.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large part of the
        reason both Daniyar and the six characters are artistically successful
        is that they are personifying the same beast: feelings that overwhelm.
        Pain is usually an overwhelming feeling, especially when exalted as it
        is in theatre. As Pirandello&rsquo;s Father character says, one never
        &ldquo;becomes so introspective as when he suffers; since he is anxious
        to get at the cause of his sufferings, to learn who has produced them,
        and whether it is just or unjust that he should have to bear
        them.&rdquo; This cogitation is often the womb in which art gestates and
        from which it is born. He continues: &ldquo;On the other hand, when he
        is happy, he takes his happiness as it comes and doesn't analyze it,
        just as if happiness were his right.&rdquo; (pg. 52) Jamila&rsquo;s
        singing, despite her pleasant voice, was not as successful in its
        artistry as them because she was not expressing emotions which could
        overwhelmed her. She was singing happily, taking it as it came, with no
        analysis. Both Aitmatov and Pirandello mark the pain&mdash;or strong
        feelings&mdash;of their characters through the presence of art.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aitmatov and Pirandello
        also frame their stories in the works of artists who are
        removed&mdash;in time (Seit) or place (the unseen
        &ldquo;author&rdquo;)&mdash;and who are also heavy with feeling.
        Displacing an artist from the main story serves to place them closer to
        the audience. The fact that Seit has painted Daniyar and Jamila making
        their escape (pg. 1) lets the audience know that the event was
        significant enough to draw the artistry from him. He is compelled to
        paint by the overwhelming emotion born of Daniyar and Jamila&rsquo;s
        love. He says, &ldquo;I had grasped the brightest edge of life,
        recreating it in my imagination in its every detail until it alone
        enveloped my every thought.&rdquo; (pg. 27) Just as Seit is possessed by
        love to capture it in visuals, so Pirandello&rsquo;s unseen
        &ldquo;author&rdquo; is possessed to create his characters: &ldquo;He
        would sit in his armchair too lazy to switch on the light, and all the
        shadows in the room were full of [the character&rsquo;s] presence coming
        to tempt him.&rdquo; (pg. 53) The extent of the compulsion is evident in
        its repercussions; Seit&rsquo;s drawings reveal him to be a conspirator
        in a scandalous affair, and the characters are eventually born from the
        author against his will. Once again, the power of human emotion is
        demonstrated, this time as external inspiration, through art.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aitmatov and Pirandello
        convey the human experience to their audience/reader outside and in.
        Contained in the primary stories we see artistic expressions of the self
        through active arts: music and drama. These serve to demonstrate
        emotional intensity within characters to each other. Surrounding this we
        see the impact of said intensity on outside observers to which we can
        relate, being observers ourselves. This is accomplished through more
        permanent forms of art&mdash;visual and linguistic. The use of these as
        an outside source, opposed to performance art in the main story,
        enhances resonance with the reader. It is as one sits still to enjoy an
        action film. We have all been stationary witnesses to evocative scenes.
        Art and feeling are intrinsically linked and universally experienced.
        This is why Aitmatov and Pirandello could use art to spike their
        narratives with a correspondent sense of human emotion accessible to
        all.
