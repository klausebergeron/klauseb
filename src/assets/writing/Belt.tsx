        A belt is a tool, many things agree&mdash;
        <br />
        buckle click, leather slide
        <br />
        ceiling fan white like
        <br />
        dirty snow outside.
        <br />
        The city-satan weaseled its way in,
        <br />
        right into your child spine,
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vertebrae click, keeping time with
        <br />
        clocks I never realized were counting down&mdash; Fine.
        <br />
        Drop down from that dusty fan
        <br />
        into the palm of a peaceful hand,
        <br />
        So I can run away
        <br />
        from the day-to-day
        <br />
        and bury my head in the sand
        <br />
      </p>
    </div>
  );
