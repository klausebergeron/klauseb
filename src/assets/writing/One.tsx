        Huge moons there wax and wane-
        <br />
        Again- again- again-
        <br />
        Every moment of the night-
        <br />
        Forever changing places-
        <br />
        And they put out the star-light
        <br />
        With the breath from their pale faces.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My left contact folded
        up under my eyelid when I finally blinked. You forget to blink sometimes
        when you’re programming; if you br/eak focus for a second you’ll likely
        spend upwards of ten extra minutes re-establishing what you were doing.
        br/eaks are exponentially counter-productive so, if you’ve got a whole
        lot of code to write, it’s best to just hammer it out without stopping
        at all. That’s how you end up like me, most days, gluey eyed and
        slack-jawed, zombie-faced stare fixed on a screen, fingers freezing from
        sitting in typing position all day but still sporting pit-stains from
        shot-gunning countless energy drinks. It is a consistent, deeply
        unpleasant surprise to hear the morning birds begin to sing—it’s always
        around 4:00am, a chorus of shrill chirps announces the official
        expiration of <span style={{ fontStyle: "italic" }}>“today”</span> as a
        time available to complete{" "}
        <span style={{ fontStyle: "italic" }}>“today”</span> tasks, making
        audible the reality that all prospective labor involved in{" "}
        <span style={{ fontStyle: "italic" }}>“tomorrow”</span> must now begin,
        and you didn’t even get to sleep.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I rubbed my eye. It made
        sticky noises loud enough to hear over the whirring of the overworked
        CPU fan. This was the third night in a row that I’d forgotten to take
        out my lenses, so they had all but turned to paste. Too lazy to find a
        mirror or even wash my hands, I peeled them off and flicked them
        aimlessly away onto the carpet. They would get lost in the mess of
        questionably clean clothes, wires, papers, chip bags, energy drink cans,
        and other crap amassing around my desk until my next bimonthly binge
        clean (which, judging by the size of the junk aggregations, would be
        soon), but I didn’t have to worry about it for the time being. I pulled
        a pair of thick framed glasses out from behind a stack of scrap paper
        and, after giving the lenses a quick wipe with my tattered hoodie
        sleeve, slid them on and directed a glossy gaze again to my workstation.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three screens glared
        back, one laptop and two for the desktop, all collaged with layers of
        open windows. Already I had lost track of the program’s structure. A
        white cubic cursor blinked at the end of the last line in the topmost
        console, expectant. The letters and characters preceding it looked like
        the result of mashing one’s head against the keyboard. I scanned them,
        registering the words individually, and the concept of an error message,
        but unable to make any use of it. I read them over, and again until they
        became nothing but lines. Eventually the lines started to squirm.
        Blinking wasn’t helping anymore. I maximized the window, filling the
        entire screen with black and white, and re-ran the code. It was a
        complicated one, and took a while to execute, printing line after line
        so rapidly it flickered, scrolling spasmodically down.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a fan becomes one
        full circle when it spins, the stream of output text started to render
        like images. As I stared, it seemed to take on the shape of a girl. Born
        from the waterfall of white pixels, she looked ethereal, beautiful but
        ghostly, with draping dress and slender limbs. I couldn’t make out the
        precise details of her face but could tell, somehow, that she was
        smiling as she combed her long, flowing hair. Something dreadful stirred
        in my stomach.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The word came out as a
        whisper before it was a complete thought.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Viviane?”
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The program stopped.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was still a moment,
        watching the cursor blink at the end of the error message. The logical
        part of my br/ain knew it was impossible, that it was a mild
        hallucination, nothing but sleep deprivation playing tricks on the mind.
        It didn’t change how fast my heart was beating, though. It certainly
        didn’t change how much I wanted to believe.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ran it again.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten seconds of text, and
        she re-appeared. This time she was sitting with her head down, hair
        hanging over the opposite shoulder as she combed it. My mouth dropped
        open a bit in disbelief. This was the exact same code; why would it look
        like a different...
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked up. The
        logical voice in my head fell silent. She was looking{" "}
        <span style={{ fontStyle: "italic" }}>at me</span>. I could see her face
        with more clarity, and the ghostly eyes were fixed on mine. In that
        moment, I had no doubts: the apparition on the screen{" "}
        <span style={{ fontStyle: "italic" }}>saw</span> me. She smiled{" "}
        <span style={{ fontStyle: "italic" }}>at me</span>.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then she said hello.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I slammed the laptop
        shut. No way. No way. There could not have been a voice. I tried taking
        slow, deep breaths. Had to get my heart rate down. Had to get to sleep.
        With violently shaking fingers, I began saving and closing all the
        windows on my desktop.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You are sleep deprived,
        you are sleep deprived,” I chanted under my breath, finally closing the
        last application and powering down the machine. Still trembling, I got
        out of my chair and threw myself onto the unmade bed. “Just go to sleep,
        just go to sleep.”
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun was creeping
        higher into the sky. With eyes clenched shut I pressed a pillow over my
        face. It seemed like an eternity, but eventually I slipped into
        turbulent dreams to the obnoxious squawk of early birds.
