        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You noticed Melody
        Breakers the instant you stepped into class. She was impossible to miss;
        her hair alone was a spectacle, cascading down around her face, pooling
        about her shoulders, and tumbling to her hips in deep, thick waves of
        green. She sat on the far side of the room by the window so that the
        morning light reflected off her head like a tanning tray. The curtain of
        hair obscured her from view, save elbows that stuck sharply out to rest
        on the desk and the lower half of what you assumed was a very long
        paisley skirt below.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A heartbeat later you
        realized you were gawking, shook your head a bit, and found a seat.
        Trying not to be obvious, you took quick, sidelong glances at her while
        fishing in your backpack for a pencil. She ran her fingers through her
        hair, flipping one side over and revealing her face. You thought she may
        have been the palest person you'd ever seen, almost translucent in the
        sun. Eyelids, heavy with lashes, were coated in glittering green shadow
        which extended down and across her well-defined cheek bones. Funny,
        you'd thought the world left body glitter in the 90s. A shirt of sequins
        hung across her shoulders, exposing lean, muscular arms. <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything about her
        sparkled. <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello everyone," came
        the teacher's voice, snapping you back to reality. "I'm Doctor Baxter,`"
        he scratched DR BAXTER across the chalk board with an emphasizing
        underline, "and this is intro to philosophy. So, it being our first day
        we're just going to go over the syllabus. If we get through that you can
        leave early, I know it's a nice day, you probably want to go to the
        beach," he carried on, dropping stacks of syllabi at the head desk of
        each row, "I know I'd rather be at the beach, so let's cooperate and
        make this as painless as possible." Students passed the papers down. You
        slipped a sheet off the top and turned to pass it on, only to realize
        with a start that the two seats between you and Melody had not been
        filled.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She turned towards you,
        finally looking you full in the face. Her eyes were like planets, wide
        and dewy, so dark you couldn't tell where iris ended and pupil began,
        and the shimmering makeup only intensified this alien effect. Tinted
        blue lips curled up to smile at you, and for the third time you realized
        how dumbstruck you must have looked.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You blinked, gave a
        short smile, a tiny laugh, passed her the papers, and snapped your eyes
        back onto Dr. Baxter.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First thing's first,
        let's take attendance." He cleared his throat and held a pencil tip to
        the top of the class list. "Jeremy Altos-I see you, Jeremy. I see a lot
        of familiar faces today, that's good. Let's see... Candida Avichii?"
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here!" someone called
        from behind you.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mhmm. Ok, Melody
        Breakers?"
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Present!" Her voice was
        as airy and sweet as cotton candy.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'm sad to say I don't
        recognize you, dear," he said, peering at her over his glasses.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, I'm new, I just
        transferred." You could listen to her all day.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, interesting! Would
        you like to tell us a little about yourself, Melody?"
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She smiled widely,
        revealing a pearly set of unexpectedly small teeth, and stood to address
        the class. "Hello, I'm Melody Breakers. My family just moved here from
        Seattle. Let's see, I love singing and swimming, especially at the
        beach-but I hate dolphins; they're rapists." A chuckle susurrated
        through the class. "I collect antique clocks and silverware and...
        yeah," she shrugged, tucking one loose lock behind a dainty ear, "I'm
        just really happy to be here, Santa Cruz is so beautiful and everyone
        has been super friendly."
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well that's great,
        Melody, we're happy to have you. You can take a seat."
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She smiled, and plopped
        back into her seat awkwardly. You were slightly taken aback by her lack
        of grace-she was built like a ballerina-but the motion shook her hair
        into mesmerizing waves which more than made up for it. Once again, she
        swooped it away from her face, catching your lingering eye and smirking.
        You snapped your head down, locking your gaze on the syllabus.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It only took twenty-five
        minutes to get through the course outline but it felt like hours as you
        struggled not to look at Melody. You tried to think of something
        else-anything else-but all the glittering and glinting in peripheral
        view was impossible to ignore. <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Dr. Baxter
        mercifully dismissed the class, you shoved the syllabus into your bag,
        crumpling it, and scrambled out of your desk. No sooner had you slung
        the bag over your shoulder than you felt two light taps on your arm.
        Nervous adrenaline zipped through every channel of blood in your body
        and you whirled around. There she was, standing perhaps an inch shorter
        than you, arms wrapped around notebooks pressed flat to her chest.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hi," she started with a
        hopeful smile, "I'm-"
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Melody!" you cut in, "I
        know... you know... from the attendance...taking." You glanced left and
        right. "Anyway, I'm-"
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Right," this time she
        interjected, "I remember you from attendance, too."
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Er, right. Cool." You
        paused, suddenly at a loss as to how normal conversations go.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She giggled, probably at
        your painful awkwardness. "So anyway, are you going to the beach?"
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You hadn't considered
        what you would do with your extra free time as you had been putting all
        your cognitive effort into not looking at Melody but it did seem like
        the best place to spend the day. "Yeah, I was going to hit up some
        friends and go, probably." <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cool! So... I don't
        really have friends around here yet but I do really want to go to the
        beach today. I don't want to go alone and don't know the area, do you
        think maybe I could come with you?"
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If your hands hadn't
        been shaky before, they were then. "Yeah-" your voice cracked like a
        broken guitar string. "Ahgm!" Mortified. "Yes, totally. Do you need a
        ride?"
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If it's not out of your
        way, I'd love one! Here," she ripped a strip of paper out of her
        notebook and scribbled down a number. "This is my phone number. I live
        on Laurel Street, text me and I'll send you the address."
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ok," you took the
        paper, raising it in confirmation, "I'll probably be going in an hour or
        two, depending on my friends."
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sounds great! I'll see
        you then. Thanks so much," she said, and winked, flipping your stomach
        over like a fish, desperately flopping back towards water. Then she
        tossed her hair over her shoulder and walked away before you could shape
        your mouth around the N in 'No problem.'
        <br />
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
        <br />
        "You. Lucky. Motherfucker." Jason picked an empty beer can off the car
        floor and squashed the butt of his cigarette into it. You lightly waved
        away the last wisps of smoke, shaking your head.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's not like I'm
        attracted to her," you refuted, "I hardly know her and, obviously, she's
        not my type. I mean, she's just..."
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Slamming hot? Crazy
        bangable? Sexy as fucking fuck? Jesus, dude."
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Seriously," chimed a
        voice from the backseat, "Even I'd hit that."
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Karen, if you cheated
        on Sam I don't know who I'd be more worried about, that'd be just...a
        mess," you replied to the small blonde behind you. "Besides, are you not
        straight, dude?"
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very funny. Anyway,
        nobody is that straight," she laughed, cracking open a fresh PBR. "I
        mean, you're not. Jason definitely isn't." <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, fuck you, Karen!"
        Jason shot back, chucking the cigarette can at her. She spat out a spray
        of beer foam in alarm, sending the pair into hysterics.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You rolled your eyes.
        "Ok, shut up assholes, this is her street."
        <br />
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
        <br />
        Melody stood outside a yellow house looking like some kind of sea-swept
        Aphrodite. The wind seemed to catch her hair in slow motion, sweeping it
        across the curves of her body and into the air. She wore a black bikini,
        a stark contrast to her skin which glowed like a gibbous moon in the
        midday light. She caught sight of you rolling up the street and waved.
        There was nowhere to park so you motioned for her to come to the car.
        She made her way over, almost tripping on the curb and breaking the fall
        against the car door. She giggled, opening it, and falling into the
        backseat beside Karen.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hell-ooo!" she sang,
        voice of sterling bells. "Sorry about that, I don't use my legs enough,
        I'm trying to get into running but man! does it turn your legs to jelly
        at first!"
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wouldn't know. I
        haven't run a day in my life. Hi, I'm Karen Phillips, alcoholic
        extraordinaire." Karen switched the beer to her left hand and offered
        Melody the right.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nice to meet you,
        Karen," replied Melody, shaking her hand. "I'm Melody Breakers, alcohol
        novice, but I have big dreams."
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karen guffawed, choking
        on more beer foam. "Oh man, I like you," she said, wiping her mouth with
        a sun-freckled arm. "We're gonna be friends."
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'm Jason!" the idiot
        interjected, twisting around to shove a hand between the two girls.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melody shook it
        politely. "Yes, you were in our class this morning, right?"
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sure was!" The
        expression on his face was pathetically ecstatic.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, did you forget to
        grab a towel?" asked Karen. "We only have the three."
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karen was right; Melody
        did not in fact have a towel. Or anything, for that matter. "No," she
        replied, "I like being wet."
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jason let out a little
        moan, and stared at you with desperate eyes. You stifled laughter,
        turning the car into the parking lot. <br />
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
        <br />
        Now that summer break had ended the beach was relatively empty. You set
        a blanket down on some warm sand in sight of the beach access. Karen
        dropped her well stocked cooler of various alcoholic beverages and one
        small bottle of water beside it. After an initial dip in the ocean the
        four of you settled down on the blanket with red solo cups full of cheap
        rum and orange juice. Conversation flowed easily with your friends
        there; no longer marinated in social anxiety you were once again the you
        you're happy to be most of the time. The alcohol didn't hurt either.
        Melody had no trouble slipping into the discussion as if she'd known you
        all for years. You grew warmer and louder with intoxication as the sun
        drooped and began to wilt into the rippling sea. Finally, when mere
        remnants of day alone kept the sky faintly glowing and stars began to
        appear behind you, Karen began to snore. It dawned on you that somewhere
        along the way Jason and Karen had phased out of the conversation. You
        peered through the cellophane barrier of drunkenness and realized you'd
        been talking to Melody alone for a while.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey," said Jason with a
        yawn, "Karen's out. I texted for a ride, Sam's on the way to pick her
        up." He stuffed his cup into the cooler with the rest of the trash and
        leftovers. "I might go too."
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You made an
        uncoordinated attempt to pat him on the head. "I'll miss you, man."
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He scoffed, closing the
        cooler. "Drink lots of water tonight, dude."
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'll make sure of it!
        Hydration is key!" sang Melody, rocking back and forth. The soft waning
        light gave her a periwinkle halo and the rum had brought a flush to her
        cheeks. "I'm not even a little bit tired." She smiled at you, her teeth
        opalescent. You marveled at how the light played such tricks, such
        delightful illusions. The gleam in her eye danced like fire.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You looked back at
        Karen, surprised to find Jason had already gotten her up, arm slung over
        his shoulder and balancing her as best he could. With his free hand,
        Jason checked his phone.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sam's here," he
        announced, giving Karen a little shake. She grumbled, swaying a bit, and
        then started staggering towards the staircase leading over the dunes to
        the street. Jason craned his neck around, "Later! Nice to meet you
        Melody!" he called back. Karen was evidently past the point of
        etiquette.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nice to meet you,
        Jason!" Melody echoed. You both waved until they had tripped and swerved
        out of sight. <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Melody looked at
        you. The black of her eyes seemed to be dilating, pushing into the
        white. Your face burned.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This was such a great
        day," she sighed, putting a delicate hand on your shoulder. Electricity
        bubbled from your stomach to your throat and surrounded your brain in
        sedating static. She slowly let her head fall closer to yours.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah. It really was,"
        you whispered back.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a moment, you sat,
        foreheads touching, listening to the rhythms of crashing waves in time
        with one another's breath. "You know what I've always wanted to do?" she
        murmured.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She drew sharply back
        with a grin. "Go skinny dipping." Your mouth dropped open but before it
        could make words she had unstrung her bikini top. Your mouth shut like a
        trap. It looked like she had put some of her eyeshadow over her skin; it
        glimmered with a green hue. You thought of fish scales. When did she
        have time to put that on?
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come on!" she
        exclaimed, bouncing up, "It will be so fun!" Grabbing your arm, she
        pulled you up, steadying you when the blood rushed spun your head. Her
        hand traced the length of your arm as she drew away. Meeting your gaze
        and, without looking away, Melody slowly slid off her bathing suit
        bottom. You were really wondering if her eyes were fully black now, but
        you followed her example. Her smile bloomed like a rosebud as she took
        your hand and led you down the shoreline.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shell fragments nipped
        at your feet and the waves were icy against your ankles but Melody held
        your hand firmly and did not slow her advance. She started humming a
        familiar song. After a moment, you identified it as Clair de Lune, and
        somehow the water didn't feel so cold anymore. Pretty soon you were
        treading water but still she pulled you deeper.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Melody, hey, I don't
        think we should be out this far..." you started.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She laughed, but her
        tone had grown an icy edge. "Not just yet."
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light was almost
        completely gone and suddenly you felt the creep of a deep, primal fear.
        "Melody..." you pulled your hand from hers and to your surprise it
        slipped right out, like it had been lubricated with some kind of slime.
        "What the..."
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that's when she
        rounded on you in the water. There was no doubt about it now, even in
        the light of the moon; her eyes were completely black. You watched in
        horror as fins split the skin of her arms, sending trickles of blood
        pooling into the water. What you thought was eyeshadow had hardened and
        grown into definitive patches of shimmering green scales. The skin of
        her neck ripped audibly opening into gills, gasping into existence like
        a newborn. She grinned at you and with newfound lucidity you realized
        her teeth were opals-only now they had grown sharp.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's the matter?" she
        hissed.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You're... you...
        what..." you stammered, flailing to keep above water.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A siren, yes," she
        sighed. "Some people say mermaid," she added casually, and lifted the
        bottom of a massive tail and slapped the water surface. "But not the
        nice or wish granting kind."
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But Seattle-" seawater
        splashed into your mouth and you began to cough.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this, she cackled.
        "SEA-attle? Get it? I thought it was funny."
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seemed the more you
        coughed the more water would catch in your throat. Desperately you
        looked around, hoping there was someone in earshot or some way to reach
        land. But there was nothing but ocean and blackness as far as you could
        see.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although it is cold,
        dark, and wet where I live," she mused. "That's kind of like Seattle.
        Well, you'll see," she laughed, "and then... you won't!"
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that she dove,
        plunging you down into the dark. You struggled to free yourself but she
        was too strong and far more dexterous in the water. Down and down you
        continued until you couldn't see your own hand in your own face and you
        lost sense of the direction...up. Which way were the bubbles going? Your
        ears popped. <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You were tired.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You stopped struggling.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You stopped holding your
        breath.
