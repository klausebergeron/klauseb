        And we lose
        <br />
        and we lose
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;until we choose defeat
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and begin throwing
        <br />
        all that’s left
        <br />
        away.
        <br />
        <br />
        I wish you had begged
        <br />
        me to stay,
        <br />
        and we’d cried in a knot
        <br />
        for what
        <br />
        could have been lost.
        <br />
        <br />
        But I walked
        <br />
        and I walked
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;down the stairs
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the apartment,
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the squelch of shoes
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;carried me
        <br />
        away.
        <br />
        <br />
        Three months spent
        <br />
        a tumbleweed rolling
        <br />
        apathetic, over dust
        <br />
        of strangers’ misplaced trust.
        <br />
        Never told a soul my real <br />
        name if I followed him to bed
        <br />
        <br />
        and I came
        <br />
        and I came.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red wine rivers
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;drowned the moans
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into holes I hadn't noticed <br />
        ‘til they were empty,
        <br />
        exposed.
        <br />
        <br />
        I want to say sorry but can’t handle <br />
        all the blame.
        <br />
        Or admit defeat, accept rejection,
        <br />
        embrace the shame <br />
        or anything everyone knows I deserve.
        <br />
        Regret is my real name.
        <br />
        <br />
        And you move on
        <br />
        and you move on--
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by the time I had
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what I wanted
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you were practically
        <br />
        gone.
        <br />
        And I crawl back
        <br />
        and I crawl back
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with desperation, but nothing
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could say will move you
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hold my chest <br />
        and shake as you push me
        <br />
        away.
